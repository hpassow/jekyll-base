I'm Heather.  I was pretty much born a geek.  I was the kid who saved all her allowance to buy faux fur so I could sew tribbles.  I painted models of the Enterprise and had them hanging from my ceiling.  I haven't become any less of a giant nerd since I've gotten older.

Hobbies include running a household in the [SCA](http://sca.org), Halloween art projects (making tombstones, carving foam pumpkins, making various creepy decor), travel, and whatever else I've found amusing at the time.  I recently started doing yoga, which I enjoy.  I'm a huge Disney fan and an Annual Pass Holder for Disneyland Anaheim.  I occasionally get turned in to a tour guide.

I'm hoping to be able to travel the world, as it's something I've wanted to do since I was little.  Until then, I'm just being me and taking life one day at a time.
